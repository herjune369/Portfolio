## Reporting a Vulnerability

If you discover a security vulnerability within this project, please send an email to security@example.com. All security vulnerabilities will be promptly addressed.

## Security Scanning

This project implements comprehensive security scanning as part of the CI/CD pipeline:

### 1. Trivy Vulnerability Scanner
- **File System Scanning**: Scans for known vulnerabilities in dependencies
- **Infrastructure as Code Scanning**: Scans Terraform configurations for security issues
- **Container Image Scanning**: Scans Docker images for vulnerabilities

### 2. Python Security Tools
- **Safety**: Checks Python dependencies for known security vulnerabilities
- **Bandit**: Static analysis tool to find common security issues in Python code

### 3. Infrastructure Security
- **Checkov**: Scans Terraform configurations for security best practices
- **Terraform Security**: Validates infrastructure configurations

## Security Requirements

### Code Security
- All code must pass security scans before deployment
- No hardcoded secrets in code
- Use environment variables for sensitive configuration
- Implement proper input validation

### Infrastructure Security
- Use least privilege principle for IAM roles
- Enable VPC Flow Logs for network monitoring
- Implement proper security groups
- Use encrypted storage for sensitive data

### Application Security
- Implement proper authentication and authorization
- Use HTTPS for all external communications
- Sanitize user inputs
- Implement proper error handling
